* [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/complete-guide-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning-with-python/learn/v4/overview)

## Section 1 - Introduction

### Lecture 1 - Introduction

* we will learn how to use Google's TensorFlow framework to prerform the latest techniques in the Deep Learning ecosystem
* we wll start with a crashcourse in the essential Python data science libraries (know them)
	* numpy
	* pandas
	* matplotlib
	* scikit learn
* we will then dive straight into Neural Networks (Perceptrons, Activation Functions, Back Propagation etc)
* Then we ll dive in Tensorflow
* A variety of networks is covered
	* Densely Connected Neural Networks (basic classification and regression tasks)
	* Convolutional Neural Networks (complex image classification tasks)
	* Recurrent Neural Networks + Long-Short Term Memory Units + Gated Recurrent units (analyze sequences of data like time series)
	* Word2Vec algorithm (word embeddings)
	* Auto Encoders (revised tasks)
* Generative Adversarial Networks 
* Reinforcement Learning with [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to teach algorithms to paly video games
